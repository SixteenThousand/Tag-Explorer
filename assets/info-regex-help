The "Information Regex" is what Tag Explorer uses
to get the title & other information from
file/directory names. "Other Information" here
could be anything, but in the books & libraries
metaphor that tag explorer uses it would most
likely be the author of the book.

The Information Regex should be a python-style
regular expression with exactly two (2) capture
groups; the first capture will be the title, and
the second will be the other information.

If you do not know how to write an appropriate 
regular expression, then simply leave this field 
blank and Tag Explorer will just use the whole 
file/directory name (minus file extensions) as 
the title, leaving the "other information" field
as blank for all books. This is also what Tag
Explorer will do in cases of books that fail to
match the regex.
