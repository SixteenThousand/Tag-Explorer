Turn this option on if you want Tag Explorer to 
use existing directory names as tags on "books".
So, for example, if we had a library with the
following structure:
	Library
	|- Topic1
	|	|- Book1
	|	|- Book2
	|- Topic2
	|	|- Book3
	|	|- SubTopic1
	|	|	|- Book4
	|	|	|- Book5
then Book2 would have the tag Topic1, Book3 would
have the tag Topic2, and Book4 would have the tags
Topic2,SubTopic1.
